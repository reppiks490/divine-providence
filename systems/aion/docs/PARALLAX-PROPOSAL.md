# PARALLAX — AION's multi-view market atlas

Status: **proposed market-state atlas**, 2026-09-23. A research-only archive
inventory is implemented as the first provenance step (ADR-0003). No
fingerprint, analog retrieval, predictive model, or execution path has been
built. This extends AION/Icarus; it does not replace the current models.

## The idea

Treat every CSV as a **view** of a market, not another independent vote. At each decision instant, combine only the completed and legitimately available observations from compatible views into a market-state fingerprint. Search earlier fingerprints to find genuinely comparable episodes. Surface both agreement and dissent among chart representations, related assets, risk sensors and exported indicators. Show what followed each historical analog *after* its own decision time, along with sample size, costs where recorded, and how often the analog failed.

The operator gets a navigable atlas: scrub a past instant, see its position among prior market states, open the nearest episodes, inspect exactly which files and rows supplied each coordinate, remove a sensor to test fragility, and watch an uncertainty dial rise when views disagree or the present has no honest analog. Synthetic stress branches have their own labels. Future outcomes remain sealed in an as-of replay. PARALLAX may abstain. It never invents a trade or a book wall from candle exports.

## Corpus audit at the accessible checkpoint

`reppiks490/multi-level-csv` at `ce82124352762c14eb33836a5c894bc3a2a71dfe` has nine ZIPs with **626 usable CSV entries**, excluding 626 `__MACOSX` resource-fork sidecars. Their data contain roughly **12,588,290 rows** excluding headers, and 157 files repeat column names. A second public repository, `reppiks490/csv-data-multi-chart-type` at `a482e7d1801fa7fa5aec093960097c0051c0403c`, contributes one ZIP with **33 usable CSV entries**, another 33 sidecars, roughly **1,199,340 rows**, and 26 duplicate-header files. Across both repositories, the accessible checkpoint is **ten ZIPs, 659 usable CSV archive entries, 542 distinct byte-exact SHA-256 contents** (117 repeated entries), roughly **13,787,630 data rows**, and 183 entries with duplicate column names. The second archive has 29 byte-distinct contents absent from the first nine. This is an archive audit, not evidence of 800 accessible files or 542 economically independent series. The owner expects roughly 800; reconcile the remainder before claiming complete coverage. The second archive includes ETHUSD: inventory its provenance, but keep it out of Icarus model or engine work under `ASTRA_DO_NOT.md` unless the owner changes that restriction.

The provider, chart transform, timezone, native timestamp meaning, first-known availability, contract roll, volume semantics and indicator provenance are **not proved by the filename**. `1M` can be monthly, `1 2` an export variant, and `1000T` a chart setting rather than authenticated tick data. A repeated timestamp can be a valid separate bar. Preserve the original ZIP/member, row number and every duplicate header occurrence by position. File hashes deduplicate exact bytes for analysis without deleting lineage entries.

## The single hybrid system

1. **Identity and availability.** Use DAEDALUS's reviewed CSV catalog where compatible. Inventory every ZIP and file with raw hash, representation identity, original header positions and source row offsets. Distinguish source close time from verified availability. Keep research-only series whose first-known time cannot be established out of strict decision replay.
2. **AION memory.** Build a time-indexed, representation-aware observation graph. Clock bars, Renko/range/tick-labeled chart exports, stock candidates and macro proxies remain distinct. Compare multiple views at a valid common decision boundary; never fabricate missing bars or intrabar chronology.
3. **State fingerprint.** Learn an auditable, masked representation of completed price geometry, volatility, breadth, leadership, rate/dollar/volatility context and explicitly labeled exported indicators such as RATE, TIDE and market profile. Record which axes were unavailable. Measure agreement across chart views and related instruments, plus novelty relative to *earlier* states. Cross-asset associations are descriptive until a separate forward test supports a leading relationship.
4. **Historical analog atlas.** Retrieve prior episodes using only features available at each query time. Show neighbors, distance by axis, source lineage, subsequent outcome distributions at named horizons, adverse moves and sample counts. Compare the learned fingerprint to simple price/regime baselines under era-blocked walk-forward evaluation with embargo for overlapping windows. Never search protected DAEDALUS holdouts for attractive examples.
5. **Adversarial sensor lens.** Recompute an inference after masking one representation, source or asset cluster. Display the change in analog neighborhoods and uncertainty; abstain when a result depends on a single fragile export, conflicting views, missing coverage or a new regime. A synthetic volatility/depth branch is explicitly hypothetical and cannot claim an alternative historical fill.
6. **Shared read-only outputs.** ATHENA receives the as-of fingerprint, dissent, novelty and uncertainty; ARGUS receives the evidence-tier boundary and genuine trade/depth only from separately authenticated feeds; DAEDALUS owns candidate evaluation, protected holdout and promotion; Icarus receives a shadow forecast ID and later recorded outcome. AION/PARALLAX cannot send orders.

## Why this changes the project

Today each export can become a separate chart or feature, allowing duplicates, transformations and repeated indicator columns to masquerade as independent agreement. PARALLAX makes *disagreement between views* a measurable input and exposes how much a forecast depends on each source. More files increase coverage and the chance to falsify a state hypothesis; they do not automatically increase confidence or trade count. The atlas is simultaneously a research index, a provenance debugger, an uncertainty detector and an explorable time machine.

## Initial delivery and acceptance

- First reconcile the **expected ~800** with the accessible 659 entries across both repositories, producing one versioned manifest of all archive/member hashes, physical entry counts, exact-byte duplicates, symbol/representation/clock claims, header positions, coverage and unresolved identities. Place a manifest beside each repository's existing raw archive, with cross-repository references; raw licensed material stays out of code history beyond the existing archives.
- Implement only on a reviewed additive branch in the shared `Icarus`/AION architecture after checking live Claude Code work and sibling contracts. Start with NQ, ES and a small reviewed candidate/risk-sensor subset, then scale the same adapter across every verified CSV. No rewrite of Pulse, Icarus execution or existing protected research.
- Test repeated timestamps, ambiguous chart suffixes, duplicated headers, non-OHLC series, missing availability, near-duplicate data, stock-vs-futures identity, corrections, horizon leakage, costs, and scenario labels. Show one complete as-of example with exact source rows and reproducible frame and model hashes.
- Gate any predictive claim on DAEDALUS-approved era-blocked walk-forward and untouched holdout, simple baselines, cost sensitivity, calibration, subgroup robustness and later shadow evidence. Report abstention and failure rates. Preserve a research-only result if these gates fail.

## Shared-agent handoff

Publish this proposal and versioned contracts to a canonical shared development branch, with an additive pointer in `Icarus` after review, so Claude Code, Codex and other agents can read the same decisions, exact commits, tests, data hashes and remaining gaps. Review the live private DAEDALUS, ATHENA and ARGUS repositories before their owner adapters are changed. Browser access to GitHub as `reppiks490` was confirmed on 2026-09-23; publication status and target commit must be updated after any actual remote write.
