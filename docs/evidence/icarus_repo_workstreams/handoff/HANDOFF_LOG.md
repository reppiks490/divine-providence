Externalized ICARUS subsystem-rotation and control-plane work to:
- `docs/icarus-control-plane/README.md`
- `docs/icarus-control-plane/SUBSYSTEM_ROTATION_FINDINGS.md`
- `docs/icarus-control-plane/UNIFIED_CYCLE_RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/icarus-control-plane/HANDOFF_STATE.json`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-icarus-control-plane-handoff.md`

No engine/strategy/execution code changed. Findings remain revision-pinned and must be reproduced before implementation. The old disconnected scheduled S1-S5 orchestration was diagnosed as lacking durable same-cycle handoff state; the replacement design is one unified sequential control cycle. `execution_authorized=false`.
